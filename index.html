        <p>I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Chinese as a Second Language at Peking University in China. I received my Ph.D. in Linguistics from the University of Southern California. My dissertation investigates how syntactic and discourse-level factors interact in reflexive resolution in Mandarin.</p>
        <p>In my academic research, I work on sentence processing, including (but not limited to) pronoun resolution in various languages such as Chinese, English, Korean, and Indonesian by drawing on different online and offline methodologies. I am also interested in the topic of logophoricity in theoretical linguistics and second language research in general.</p>
        <p>I welcome collaboration on topics related to anaphora and cataphora resolution in L1 and L2. If you are interested in my research, feel free to get in touch with me.</p>
        <p>When not doing research and teaching, I enjoy going out to nature and frequently go hiking in the suburbs of Beijing and the neighboring cities. After completing my Ph.D., I have come to realize the importance of mental health and physical health. I try not to feel guilty when taking the entire weekend off from work!</p>
